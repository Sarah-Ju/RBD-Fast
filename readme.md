# RBD-FAST on Python
## This is an implementation of sensitivity analysis algorithm RBD-FAST
 
This implementaton is from Sarah JURICIC, based on Matlab code from Mickael RABOUILLE.
RBD-FAST is known to be a robust sensitivity analysis method for model with large computationnal cost.

### Original algorithm:

### Update: M. Rabouille

Add: Reordering Y according a random design X (EASI algorithm) from E Plischke.
Add: Unbiased estimator from J-Y Tissot & C Prieur.
Note: The estimate is less dependant on the M value which can be raised up to 10.
